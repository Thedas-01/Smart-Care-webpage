      <h1>Research Gap</h1>
      <p>
        Technological advances in healthcare have made significant progress in areas such as fall detection, wound recognition, 
        and hospital resource tracking. However, these solutions often function independently within isolated silos, lacking 
        integration and real-time adaptability. Existing systems typically focus on narrow problems with limited interoperability, 
        predictive capabilities, or coordination across emergency care, triage, resource management, and patient safety. This 
        fragmentation limits their effectiveness in addressing complex, dynamic healthcare needs that require anticipatory and 
        responsive support.
