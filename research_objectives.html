      <h1>Research Objectives</h1>
      <ul class="custom-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Develop an IoT-based</strong> emergency fall detection and response module using wearable 
            sensors (ESP32 and MPU6050) to monitor patient movements, detect falls in real time, 
            capture GPS location, and automatically notify nearby hospitals and ambulance services via a mobile app.<br/>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Implement an AI-powered woun</strong> classification and triage recommendation system 
          that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on a diverse wound image dataset to classify 
          injury types, estimate severity, and suggest appropriate treatment pathways integrated into a mobile-accessible 
          interface for emergency medical personnel.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Design and deploy</strong> a predictive resource management system utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) 
          models trained on historical hospital data to forecast ICU bed availability and medicine stock needs, enabling 
          proactive resource allocation through a user-friendly dashboard connected to hospital systems.

        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Develop a</strong> smart blood inventory management and emergency coordination platform combining 
          hybrid ML models (ARIMA and LSTM) for blood demand forecasting, GPS-based donor tracking, and automated donor 
          outreach via SMS/email to optimize blood supply, reduce wastage, and improve emergency response logistics.
        </li>
        
        <li>
          <strong>Integrate all modules into a unified,</strong> interoperable SMARTCARE system with real-time data 
          synchronization, secure cloud infrastructure, intuitive user interfaces, and compliance with healthcare data 
          privacy standards to ensure seamless coordination among patients, caregivers, hospitals, and emergency responders.
